# Rust Practice Projects

Welcome to **rust-practice-projects**! 🚀 This repository is a collection of my Rust learning projects, where I experiment with different Rust concepts, from the basics to advanced topics like concurrency, memory safety, and system programming.

## 📌 About
This repository serves as a structured space for practicing and improving my Rust skills. Each project focuses on a specific Rust feature or concept, making it easier to track progress and revisit learnings.

## 📂 Project Structure
Each folder contains a separate Rust project with its own `Cargo.toml` file and source code:
```
rust-practice-projects/
│── project-1/  
│── project-2/ 
│── project-3/ 
│── ...
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run any project, navigate into its folder and use Cargo:
```sh
cd project-name
cargo run
```

## 📚 Topics Covered
- 🦀 Rust Basics (Variables, Functions, Ownership, Borrowing)
- 🔄 Iterators and Collections
- 📦 Modules and Crates
